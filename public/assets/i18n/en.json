My journey into programming began during my master's studies, where I gained foundational knowledge in Python for data analysis. Having completed my front-end development training, I am now expanding my expertise into back-end development to become a full-stack developer. I am passionate about coding and aim to pursue a professional career as a skilled programmer.",
